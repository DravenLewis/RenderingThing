You are regenerating the local docs site in ./doc for RenderingThing.

Goals:
- Keep Microsoft Learn-style layout and styling already present in doc/style.css and doc/app.js.
- All resources must remain local (no CDN).
- Use per-class reference pages under doc/reference/ with a left nav listing every class.
- Exclude any files under src/STB/ and src/debug_helpers/ and exclude STBTrueTypeFont.*.
- Each class page must include sections in this order:
  1) Title, summary, header path
  2) Usage example with code block + copy button
  3) Member tables (Member Types, Constructors/Destructors, Member Functions, Static Functions, Public Data)
  4) Public API code block
  5) Full Class Layout code block
- Member tables should list signatures + short descriptions.
- Maintain the Settings panel behavior (theme, accent color list from Color.h; close on outside click; use Bootstrap Icons locally).
- Highlight cards on the Overview page should link to relevant reference pages.
- Border radius max is 5px app-wide.

Suggested workflow:
- Parse headers in src/*.h, excluding STB and debug_helpers.
- Extract class/struct blocks and public sections.
- Generate doc/reference/index.html and per-class pages.
- Update top-level pages to include new reference links.
- Do not change overall styling unless requested.
